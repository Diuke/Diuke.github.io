# Hello World!

I'm Juan Pablo Duque Ordo√±ez, Nice to meet you üòÅ!

Ph.D. student at Politecnico di Milano by day, and Web GIS developer at night (well, also at day). My goal is to put my coding skills and knowledge to the service of the GIS community. I love maps, geography, and learning about the beautiful and diverse world be live in.

I'm mostly interested in Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial (FOSS4G), specially when the internet is involved. I'm also passionate about the OGC and modern Open Geospatial Standards.

This same information, but slightly more beautiful is in my websige. Give a look at [diuke.github.io](https://diuke.github.io)
